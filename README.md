# TCP/IP Chat System

This Chat System is built using TCP/IP as the communications protocol and consists of two parts; the Chat Client and the Chat Server. The Chat Client is a WPF solution that can run as multiple clients on one or more computers, while the Chat Server is a C# Console application that can be run on any computer, including the same computer as the client(s).
